EVERY THU. 7-9PM.Gurdjieffs Fourth Way, now in the midst of the 21st Century appears as an important way of understanding what humanity is being called upon to undertake. George Gurdjieff had a firm grasp of an abstract  method that was not based on belief but on the living action of deep inquiry. He is widely recognized as being pretty unique in disdaining belief and advocating an empirical approach, find out for yourself or self-validation as it were.Meaning arises when we take hold of something for ourselves. We can only do this by investing something of ourselves. In doing this, we make something newOne of the most valuable products of Gurdjieff's teaching consists of a series of 'movements' (sometimes called 'sacred gymnastics'), and accompanying music particular to each dance. The movements were created and intended to transmit the teachings entirely through dance. They can enter into our bodies as sensation and liberate insight through feeling. To get into sensation requires the suspension of the ingrained 'body-image' we have that overlays the body's own consciousness.The movements are abstract exercises; neither gymnastics nor physiotherapy, and are not meant to create altered states of consciousness (even though this might happen as the automatic result of a work of attention). Their raison dtre has to be found in the body of ideas structuring the teaching.Here is an invitation to participate in Group-Work and to experiment with putting Work ideas into practice. Groups have a mind of their own that exhibits phenomena we cannot otherwise access. At the heart of it is just basic human contact, one person meeting with another just as they might meet themselves.June 23rd onwards.EVERY THURSDAY7-9PMRs. 300 /sessionRs. 3000 /12 sessionsRs. 1500 (professional artists and students - please mail us with your cv or valid student ID to receive the regn link)Please feel free to contact Tabasheer if you would like more information at: tzutshi | gmail ! com or +91 98203 91583The very first moment you have an opportunity to lose your attention  you will! G.I. GurdjieffOur movement (in the world) is composed of a set of typical or recurrent postures. We walk in a certain way, talk in a certain way, and sit in a certain way. These ways are finite and limited. Most peoples movement exhibit considerable waste of energy.Gurdjieff drew attention to our limited repertoire of postures and movements and said it included feelings and thoughts as well. Thoughts, feelings and movements are linked together in a mechanical way. But there is something to be explored beyond this mechanical system. The intention is not physical fitness but awakening to some inner existence.The dances and movements, which Gurdjieff taught were partially a result of his research in the monasteries and schools of Asia, and are of a nature that seems unique in the modern Western world. In certain respect they are comparable to sacred dances in traditional religious systems (for example, the Cham dances of Tibetan Buddhism or the dervish dances of the Sufis).  Like them, the Gurdjieff Movements are based on the view that a series of specific postures, gestures, and movements, supported by an intentional use of melody and rhythm and an essential element of right individual effort, can help to evoke an inner condition which is closer to a more conscious existence, or a state of unity, which can allow an opening to the conscious energy of the Self.  The crucial component of Gurdjieffs teaching is conscious attention. Like all of Gurdjieffs ideas this one is not meant to remain of abstract interest, possibly even great abstract interest; not meant to stay in the book, but to leap off the page, asking to be lived as a primary, direct, verifiable experience.To see requires an attention that is active, not simply one produced by the shock of an impression. We need to realize that our usual attention is not in contact with what it perceives, and as a result we do not really see. For this contact, the attention must become active. To be present requires dividing the attention. The movements are in many ways like a hologram of the Fourth Way; that is, they are a means of teaching our three major centers to work together  the intellectual, emotional and moving. They consist of abstract gestures and positions that have mathematical precision. However, the deeper emphasis in movements is on inner work that develops in time.Music has a vital role to play in transmitting these teachings. Each movement has a piece of music especially composed for it in order to facilitate the desired effect on the practitioner. The true function of music has absolutely nothing to do with \"accompaniment\" but is a living part of the inner work that takes place in the classes. The sessions will give you time to draw breath and pause a while, for you to be with yourself in a relationship of trust and wholeness. It is for creating spaces of meaning where you will not be judged by others nor, hopefully, even by yourself, but allow a creation to arise in them.In every act of will there is a beginning of something new and the only thing that corresponds to an act of will is creative energy. . . .About the facilitator:Tabasheer Zutshi began her journey with the Work in 2001 in Delhi when circumstances brought her to visit a psychotherapist, Akash Dharmaraj. Akash had recently set up a Fourth way school called Akhaldans. Here Tabasheer was introduced to Gurdjieffs dances and movements for the first time. Over the next decade her practice deepened and she also participated in a number of public Movement Demonstrations. Parallel to her inquiry of the Fourth Way, she began learning Transactional Analysis as a means to compliment her practice from a more psychological perspective. As her study intensified she trained with other senior practitioners of the work from the J.G. Bennet Lineage. Bennet was a direct student of Gurdjieff and one of the few who carried his work forward after his death. Later, under the guidance of her teacher she was trained and nominated a teacher of the movements. Tabasheer now explores Gurdjieffs teachings from the perspective of the 21st century and its relevance today.Born in Bombay in 1975, Tabasheer Zutshi graduated in Ancient Indian Culture from St. Xaviers College, Bombay and later studied painting at The Delhi College of Art. Professionally she is a Production and Costume designer. She has worked on award winning Independent films. Her work extends to theatre, site-specific installation and performance art. Her artist collaborations as Costume Designer and Art Director have been part of art and theatre festivals such as the Yokohama Triennale, Kunst Festival des arts, (Brussels), National School of Drama theatre festival (N. Delhi), and at the Baroda Palace. She has collaborated with experimental sound artists in site-specific installations.She views environments as possessing a metaphysical quality that impacts the viewers perception of the narrative and characters. She experiments with the minutiae of everyday life and found objects to bring an emotional and sensorial response to her work.Currently she lives in Bangalore and is an almost full time gardener."}, {"category": "festivals", "eventLink": "https://allevents.in/bangalore/ramadan-iftar-festival/922778684499147", "name": "Ramadan Iftar Festival", "stop_date": "   to  Fri Jun 24 2016", "locationName": "Slurp Studio bangalore", "str_date": "Fri Jun 24 2016", "stop_time": "10:00 pm", "str_time": "06:00 pm", "image": "https://graph.facebook.com/922778684499147/picture", "description": ""}, {"category": "festivals", "eventLink": "https://allevents.in/bangalore/the-humming-tree-presents-daniel-waples-thaalavattam-india-tour-at-the-humming-tree/247758525598964", "name": "The Humming Tree presents Daniel Waples + Thaalavattam India Tour at The Humming Tree", "stop_date": null, "locationName": "The Humming Tree bangalore", "str_date": "Sat Jun 25 2016", "stop_time": null, "str_time": "08:00 pm", "image": "https://cdn-az.allevents.in/banners/9587586d00d40e697f65de0b5dd7e914", "description": "   Entry: 500-----------------------------------------Daniel Waples & Thaalavattam-----------------------------------------Curating the nuances of percussion with the energy of the hand pan, Thaalavattam and Daniel Waples come together to create a fervent organic collaboration. This summer they tour through India, covering 4 different cities Hyderabad, Delhi, Mumbai & Bangalore.This organic collaboration traces back to the OZORA music festival, 2014 at Hungary where Montry and Daniel met, and their zealous passion for creating Music With a Cause brought them together. Thaalavattam, which means A Circle of Rhythm, is Montrys percussion-project that harnesses the universal power of music to inspire people to REDUCE, REUSE, and RETUNE. The organic grooves emerge from discarded tubes, paint cans, plastic bottles etc. which are reborn a hybrid percussion kits. Daniel Waples is famously known to travel the world & inspire smiles whilst spreading the gospel of the Hand Pan, an instrument whose melodies are associated with energy, alternative healing and one which Daniels hopes will become a symbol for universal peace inner journeys that people take in their individual paths.For the first time in India, Thaalavattam and Daniel took stage at The Humming Tree, Bangalore in January 2016 and their performance left the crowd longing for more.

Twenty years later, it is quite another past that stands in their way.Today, two whimsical narrators scramble madly to recreate what happened. Set against the background of the Kashmir imbroglio, Gasha is an account of the fractured friendship between two boys, a Kashmiri Pandit and a Kashmiri Muslim and their need to affirm their storyPerformed by: Sandeep Shikhar & Adhir bhatWritten by: Irawati KarnikConceived and directed by: Abhishek MajumdarScenography: Payal WadhwaDramaturgy: Subhashim GoswamiSound: Abhijit PakrashiLights :Mohammad MustafaCostumes: Divya JainAssistant direction: Virginia RodriguesProduction manager: BharaviDuration : 100 mins-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------23rd & 24th June 2016 | 7.30 PM | Ranga Shankara  Hayavadana In collaboration with Fanatika & TransIndus Foundation The play is an adaptation of Girish Karnad's 'Hayavadana' in Gujarati & Hindi using elements from the folk-form Bhavai, in which, Hayavadana , the horse-headed man arrives in a fictional town called Bhavaipur, as part of his pilgrimage to rid himself of the curse and ends up interrupting a bhavai performance . In a classic play within a play structure, where the main plot is of a triangular love story between Devdatt, Kapil and Padmini centered around the question of mind-body duality, the sub-plot of Hayavadana deepens the significance of the main theme of incompleteness.The play uses puppets, masks and live music drawn from Bhavai and other folk traditions.Performed by: Satchit Puranik, Rupanshi Kashyap, Pratik Rathod and others.Written by: Girish KarnadAdapted by: Satchit Puranik & Chanakya VyasDirected by: Chanakya VyasDramaturgy: Chintan PandyaMusic: Bhargav Purohit - Maulik NayakCostumes: Swati BhartiaProduction Management : Megha MehtaVisual Design : Pratyush SinghLight Design : Vinay Chandra PDuration : 100 mins-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------25th & 26th June 2016 | 3.30 PM & 7.30 PM | Ranga Shankara  KaumudiKaumudi is about a rite of passage. Using the moonlit timeless night when Krishna delivers his sermon to Arjuna as its central trope, this play explores the dynamics between an estranged father-son duo who play Eklavya's ghost and Abhimanyu respectively, in a theatre, in late 1960's Allahabad. The father, Satyasheel, who is a great actor and has almost lost his sight, is at his final three performances. Thus son, Paritosh, who grew up with the void of not having a father by his side, has come to challenge not only the father but also his entire school of thought.Kaumudi is hinged on three central questions: Whose life is more valuable, an older or a younger persons? Is personal ethic more important than public ethic? Does art have a function, and do we make art or does art make us? It also holds up a mirror to it and questions theatre: Does theatre have a meaning or is it our ego being massaged? Whose theatre is it that of the audience or of the practitioner?Kaumudi has been inspired by two texts: Anands Malayalam novel Vyasam Vigneswaram and Jorge Luis Borges essay Blindness.Performed by Kumud Mishra, Sandeep Shikhar, Gopal Datt & Shubhrajyoti BaratMusic and Sound Design by Abhijeet TambeWritten and Directed by Abhishek MajumdarScenography: Payal Wadhwa and Rajesh SinghDramaturgy: Irawati KarnikCostumes: Pallavi KrishnaLight Design: Anmol VellaniLight execution: Niranjan GokhaleProduction assistants: Ajay KshatriyaBackstage support: Abubakar SiddiqAsst Direction: Neel Sengupta and Anshuman AcharyaCommunication: Abhijit PakrashiProduction Management: BharaviDuration : 125 minsRiad Foundation has supported the making of all 3 plays ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------About Indian Ensemble Indian Ensemble was founded in 2009 by Abhishek Majumdar and Sandeep Shikhar, a reputed and acclaimed multi-lingual theatre company based out of Bangalore that produces and supports theatre work which is fundamentally Indian in its context.

The event is free of charge for all nature and travel admirers. [We shall share the expenses of chai and snacks :) ]The film is about multi-modal communication found among some rare & endemic species of frogs found in Western ghats, India. From time immemorial the graceful courtship behaviour of a peafowl has inspired reams of poetic verses, some one with a sweet voice is always compared to Indian Koel (a song bird) or perhaps the royal Bengal tiger represents everything that is majestic!. In this film the call of a frog is modelled in to syllables (known as konnakol) used in the percussion instruments of Indian classical music. That makes frogs as percussionists! Equally fascinating is another weird behaviour - foot flagging found among a certain species of frogs commonly known as dancing frogs. The film throws some new light on to this behaviour buttressed by solid research. The behaviour is similar to foot stomping among Sumo wrestlers. Through Wrestlers of western ghats, the producer intends to encourage the audience to develop fresh perspectives about the wonderful natural world of which we are an inseparable part. The film is expected to fire up the imagination of viewers - scientists and general audience alike.About the speaker: Srikanth KashyapFor almost a decade and a half, Srikanth had the opportunity to witness and photograph some rare moments in nature. He has been fortunate enough to trek and travel wild-scapes stretching from his backyard to national parks while he continued to work on subjects ranging from chip design, applied mathematics and designing embedded control systems meant for power systems protection applications. He also designs and offers regular 2 credit courses in the area of advanced power systems protection at universities. As part of ILAA Photography, Srikanth offer a number of thematic workshops for novices and serious hobbyists. His work has found its way in to some of the magazines and children's book. Some of Srikanths recent works are listed here: A book on river Cauveri (Pratham books) featured pictures of birds from Ranganathittu as a centre spread feature,Bhoomi magazine published his pictures for an article on ecology,He has also contributed to some corporate calendars  his calendar for 2012 won a national award. A blue jay's image qualified as a finalist in a prestigious international contest - Honourable mention  2012 Work on blue tailed bee eaters was published in Saevus."}, {"category": "music", "eventLink": "https://allevents.in/bangalore/old-cottonians-ball-2016/549155985271741", "name": "Old Cottonians' Ball 2016!", "stop_date": null, "locationName": "JW Marriott Hotel Bengaluru bangalore", "str_date": "Sat Jun 25 2016", "stop_time": null, "str_time": "07:00 pm", "image": "https://graph.facebook.com/549155985271741/picture", "description": "   The Old Cottonians' Association is delighted to announce the 2016 Edition of the Old Cottonians' Ball, our grand annual reunion!Date: June 25, 2016 (Saturday)Time: 7.00 p.m onwardsVenue: JW Marriott             24/1 Vittal Mallya Road,             Bangalore 560 001Lip-smacking food & drinks.

This summer they tour through India, covering 4 different cities Hyderabad, Delhi, Mumbai & Bangalore.This organic collaboration traces back to the OZORA music festival, 2014 at Hungary where Montry and Daniel met, and their zealous passion for creating Music With a Cause brought them together. Thaalavattam, which means A Circle of Rhythm, is Montrys percussion-project that harnesses the universal power of music to inspire people to REDUCE, REUSE, and RETUNE. The organic grooves emerge from discarded tubes, paint cans, plastic bottles etc. which are reborn a hybrid percussion kits. Daniel Waples is famously known to travel the world & inspire smiles whilst spreading the gospel of the Hand Pan, an instrument whose melodies are associated with energy, alternative healing and one which Daniels hopes will become a symbol for universal peace inner journeys that people take in their individual paths.For the first time in India, Thaalavattam and Daniel took stage at The Humming Tree, Bangalore in January 2016 and their performance left the crowd longing for more. Their electrifying collaboration is the flavor for the music season and their much-awaited tour this summer will be the next leap for this beautiful organic curation which we are certain will have an overwhelming response.--------------------------The Humming Tree---------------------------The Humming Tree is a concept Live Music and Arts Venue (operating as a bar/caf as well) opened in June, 2013 and located in Bangalore, India.http://www.thehummingtree.com/https://twitter.com/The_HummingTreehttps://www.facebook.com/thehummingtreehttp://instagram.com/the_hummingtreehttps://soundcloud.com/thehummingtreehttps://www.youtube.com/user/thehummingtreemusicPowered by Treebo Hotels."}, {"category": "music", "eventLink": "https://allevents.in/bangalore/sanctum-presents-red-carpet-clubbing-ft-rohit-barker/1785789358374115", "name": "Sanctum presents Red Carpet Clubbing ft.

A dynamic producer, the Swede has become a key part of Steve Angellos Size Records and signed an album deal with Ultra Music as well as appearing on standout labels such as Mixmash and Spinnin.

It is so normal that most people dont even know that it is against the law. Jhatkaa.org has launched a month-long campaign to tackle this issue in Bangalore. The campaign aims to put pressure on the BBMP to enforce the existing ban on garbage burning in the city. Give a missed call on 7676-022-555 to show your support to end open garbage burning in Bangalore.Sundeep Rao is India's only blind comic... actually partially blind! He brings to his stand-up comedy his comic foresight, which unlike his sight is rather clear. Influenced by Indians and inspired by the world, Sundeep has been a professional comic since 2012 and has emerged as one of the senior- most and extremely talented performers among his peers. An improvisational actor and voice-over artist, he brings a finesse and unique style with his dry humour, across Indian and international stages!Sundeep's solo comedy specials 'Out of Sight' and 'Split Ends' have brought him rave reviews. Sundeep will perform with colleagues Kanan Gill and Anirban Dasgupta, both of whom have made an indelible mark on the comedy scene in India.Kanan Gill can be described as the tip of an iceberg, where the rest of the iceberg is a confused Punjabi under water. He is a  stand-up comedian, actor, writer, musician, software engineer, fitness enthusiast and slightly creepy man. He exploded onto the stand-up comedy scene by winning the Punch Line Bangalore competition, going straight on to win the open mic at The Comedy Store in Bombay. His 'Feelings in India' tour won him an even larger fan base and Kanan is presently inundated with success from his online comedy film cameos 'Most Pretentious' Film Reviews and other videos. From small intimate spaces to big stages, Kanan Gill is a natural born funny guy with charisma and charm to boot.Anirban Dasgupta is a comedian, writer and full-time married person from Kolkata, now living in Bombay. Unsubstantiated reports claim that he is the hardest working Bengali in the world.   Anirban has performed extensively across the country and is a regular feature at the India's premier comedy clubs and festivals. He was awarded Youth Star by Radio One for his work in comedy over the last couple of years, and he recently debuted his first comedy special titled Polite Provocations to great reviews in several cities."}, {"category": "music", "eventLink": "https://allevents.in/bangalore%20urban/live-to-eat-be-your-own-doc-level-1-workshop-series/290633117953422", "name": "Live to Eat - Be Your Own Doc Level 1 Workshop Series", "stop_date": null, "locationName": "PHC Lifestyle Clinic bangalore", "str_date": "Sun Jun 26 2016", "stop_time": null, "str_time": "09:00 am", "image": "https://cdn-az.allevents.in/banners/10ad62266c84024af235ebc627985cf9", "description": "   Live to Eat is a mouth watering one day workshop that gives you insight into the way every animal in the world eats, as well as the cooking secrets of Ancient India.Youre a foodie.

EVERY THU. 7-9PM.Gurdjieffs Fourth Way, now in the midst of the 21st Century appears as an important way of understanding what humanity is being called upon to undertake. George Gurdjieff had a firm grasp of an abstract  method that was not based on belief but on the living action of deep inquiry. He is widely recognized as being pretty unique in disdaining belief and advocating an empirical approach, find out for yourself or self-validation as it were.Meaning arises when we take hold of something for ourselves. We can only do this by investing something of ourselves. In doing this, we make something newOne of the most valuable products of Gurdjieff's teaching consists of a series of 'movements' (sometimes called 'sacred gymnastics'), and accompanying music particular to each dance. The movements were created and intended to transmit the teachings entirely through dance. They can enter into our bodies as sensation and liberate insight through feeling. To get into sensation requires the suspension of the ingrained 'body-image' we have that overlays the body's own consciousness.The movements are abstract exercises; neither gymnastics nor physiotherapy, and are not meant to create altered states of consciousness (even though this might happen as the automatic result of a work of attention). Their raison dtre has to be found in the body of ideas structuring the teaching.Here is an invitation to participate in Group-Work and to experiment with putting Work ideas into practice. Groups have a mind of their own that exhibits phenomena we cannot otherwise access. At the heart of it is just basic human contact, one person meeting with another just as they might meet themselves.June 23rd onwards.EVERY THURSDAY7-9PMRs. 300 /sessionRs. 3000 /12 sessionsRs. 1500 (professional artists and students - please mail us with your cv or valid student ID to receive the regn link)Please feel free to contact Tabasheer if you would like more information at: tzutshi | gmail ! com or +91 98203 91583The very first moment you have an opportunity to lose your attention  you will! G.I. GurdjieffOur movement (in the world) is composed of a set of typical or recurrent postures. We walk in a certain way, talk in a certain way, and sit in a certain way. These ways are finite and limited. Most peoples movement exhibit considerable waste of energy.Gurdjieff drew attention to our limited repertoire of postures and movements and said it included feelings and thoughts as well. Thoughts, feelings and movements are linked together in a mechanical way. But there is something to be explored beyond this mechanical system. The intention is not physical fitness but awakening to some inner existence.The dances and movements, which Gurdjieff taught were partially a result of his research in the monasteries and schools of Asia, and are of a nature that seems unique in the modern Western world. In certain respect they are comparable to sacred dances in traditional religious systems (for example, the Cham dances of Tibetan Buddhism or the dervish dances of the Sufis).  Like them, the Gurdjieff Movements are based on the view that a series of specific postures, gestures, and movements, supported by an intentional use of melody and rhythm and an essential element of right individual effort, can help to evoke an inner condition which is closer to a more conscious existence, or a state of unity, which can allow an opening to the conscious energy of the Self.  The crucial component of Gurdjieffs teaching is conscious attention. Like all of Gurdjieffs ideas this one is not meant to remain of abstract interest, possibly even great abstract interest; not meant to stay in the book, but to leap off the page, asking to be lived as a primary, direct, verifiable experience.To see requires an attention that is active, not simply one produced by the shock of an impression. We need to realize that our usual attention is not in contact with what it perceives, and as a result we do not really see. For this contact, the attention must become active. To be present requires dividing the attention. The movements are in many ways like a hologram of the Fourth Way; that is, they are a means of teaching our three major centers to work together  the intellectual, emotional and moving. They consist of abstract gestures and positions that have mathematical precision. However, the deeper emphasis in movements is on inner work that develops in time.Music has a vital role to play in transmitting these teachings. Each movement has a piece of music especially composed for it in order to facilitate the desired effect on the practitioner. The true function of music has absolutely nothing to do with \"accompaniment\" but is a living part of the inner work that takes place in the classes. The sessions will give you time to draw breath and pause a while, for you to be with yourself in a relationship of trust and wholeness. It is for creating spaces of meaning where you will not be judged by others nor, hopefully, even by yourself, but allow a creation to arise in them.In every act of will there is a beginning of something new and the only thing that corresponds to an act of will is creative energy. . . .About the facilitator:Tabasheer Zutshi began her journey with the Work in 2001 in Delhi when circumstances brought her to visit a psychotherapist, Akash Dharmaraj. Akash had recently set up a Fourth way school called Akhaldans. Here Tabasheer was introduced to Gurdjieffs dances and movements for the first time. Over the next decade her practice deepened and she also participated in a number of public Movement Demonstrations. Parallel to her inquiry of the Fourth Way, she began learning Transactional Analysis as a means to compliment her practice from a more psychological perspective. As her study intensified she trained with other senior practitioners of the work from the J.G. Bennet Lineage. Bennet was a direct student of Gurdjieff and one of the few who carried his work forward after his death. Later, under the guidance of her teacher she was trained and nominated a teacher of the movements. Tabasheer now explores Gurdjieffs teachings from the perspective of the 21st century and its relevance today.Born in Bombay in 1975, Tabasheer Zutshi graduated in Ancient Indian Culture from St. Xaviers College, Bombay and later studied painting at The Delhi College of Art. Professionally she is a Production and Costume designer. She has worked on award winning Independent films. Her work extends to theatre, site-specific installation and performance art. Her artist collaborations as Costume Designer and Art Director have been part of art and theatre festivals such as the Yokohama Triennale, Kunst Festival des arts, (Brussels), National School of Drama theatre festival (N. Delhi), and at the Baroda Palace. She has collaborated with experimental sound artists in site-specific installations.She views environments as possessing a metaphysical quality that impacts the viewers perception of the narrative and characters. She experiments with the minutiae of everyday life and found objects to bring an emotional and sensorial response to her work.Currently she lives in Bangalore and is an almost full time gardener."}, {"category": "sports", "eventLink": "https://allevents.in/bangalore/game-square-june-combat-2016/80001742530334", "name": "Game Square June Combat 2016", "stop_date": "   to  Sat Jun 25 2016", "locationName": "Game Sqaure bangalore", "str_date": "Fri Jun 24 2016", "stop_time": "10:00 pm", "str_time": "10:00 am", "image": "https://cdn5.allevents.in/images/dates/24-JUN_60x60.jpg", "description": "   Yo !!

It is an effective method of connecting with the unconscious mind to uplift your mental attitude. Once you get your body relaxed and calm, and your mind receptive your chi will begin to circulate. And that will start your spirits soaring.'Unpressurize to Innovate' Think something is too hard? Thats probably exactly where you should focus your energy. Think something is as far as the moon?

Sit back and relax as youre driven in a private coach, to reach Thimpu, the smallest capital city in the world (11.5 hours). On the route: the Tachog Lhakhang Bridge built by Thangtong Gyalpo. Well also drive past Chuzom, the meeting point of the Paro and Thimpu rivers. The last part of the journey is just a short 15-minute stretch from Simtokha to Thimpu, your home for the next three days.A welcome dinner with a live folk dance performance is waiting for you at the hotel. Day 2:After breakfast: well get our bearings of Thimpu on a guided tour(3 hours).On our route: a visit to the National Library which houses an extensive collection of priceless Buddhist manuscripts. Perseverance is the mantra of The Institute for Zorig Chusum which is where you will be heading to next. Well also visit the Textile and Folk Heritage Museum which showcase the nations rich heritage.Afterwards, well continue our tour, stopping first visit the Kings Memorial Chorten. Then, visit the government-run Handicrafts Emporium and local crafts shops.On the way back to the hotel, youll drive past the Trashi Chhoe Dzong (Fortress of the Glorious Religion), the site of monarchs throne room and seat of Je Khenpo or Chief Abbot, where all important government and religious decisions are made.Day 3:This morning, wake a bit early, have a quick bite to eat and then - a drive up to the 10,130 ft Dochu-la Pass. Next: Punakha Dzong, another confluence but with two different rivers  Mo Chhu (Mother) and Pho Chhu (Father) via Wangdiphodrang. Afterwards, well walk to Chimi Lakhang, a fertility temple nestled in the countryside, and said to have been built by a Tibetan saint known as the Divine Madman (who, according to legend, used to defeat demons with his you-know-what).Well head to Punakha for the night.Day 4:After breakfast, its time for some action. Were going to an archery competition!The Bhutanese are obsessed with their national sport, and almost every village has their own archery range with multi-day competitions taking place throughout the year.Then: its time for a drive to Paro from Punakha.(4 hours)You may like to stop for a traditional lunch at Thimphu (dont forget to try a sip of asa (a rice liquor) or local Red Panda beer) and perhaps do some last minute souvenir shopping on the way.Day 5:This morning: well drive up the valley to the ruins of Drukgyel Dzong.Then: a highlight of our holiday - well hike up to the Taktsang Monastery, the most famous and holiest of Bhutanese monasteries, popularly known as Paro Taktsang (this will take around two hours).

Contrary to popular beliefs that you'd have to abandon the material world of chocolates,  wood fired pizzas,  cute cats and Anushka Sharma and run to the foot hills of Himalayas and stand nearly naked on one leg, with arms outstreched to attain samadhi, the program is designed practically so that you get access to samadhi in a fraction of the time it takes our planet to do a good spin about itself. Oh, and yes, you can sit down. As comfortably as you like.Dates: 1-3rd JulyVenue: Gyan Mandir, 11th Main, 4th T Block, Jayanagar,  Bangalore. Timings: 1st and 2nd July (Friday and Saturday): 6-8pm                  3rd July: 9-11amThe program will be taught by Swami Purnachaitanya. Swami Purnachaitanya was born in Leyden, a small town in The Netherlands in 1984. Spiritual values were an important part of his upbringing and when he was four years old his parents introduced him to the practice of meditation and satsang. His mother being from India and his father having a Christian background, he was introduced to spiritual teachings from both the East and the West during his childhood. From an early age Swami Purnachaitanya showed a keen interest in the spiritual practices, cultures and philosophies of the East. This initially led him to practice a wide range of Eastern martial arts, such as judo, taekwondo, ninpo bujutsu, wushu (kung fu) and aikido. Over the years he realized, however, that it was not the fighting skills, but human values, philosophies and meditation that attracted him. To get a glimpse into his life and his journey, do visit his blog at http://www.swamipurnachaitanya.com/en/biography "}, {"category": "sports", "eventLink": "https://allevents.in/bangalore/whispering-woods-coorg/1582282932101446", "name": "Whispering Woods : Coorg", "stop_date": null, "locationName": "Bangalore bangalore", "str_date": "Fri Jul 01 2016", "stop_time": null, "str_time": "10:00 pm", "image": "https://cdn-az.allevents.in/banners/e389cad8268a1f209355a02e15eff1b0", "description": "   This monsoon, we take you to a different Coorg  with an extra dose of adventure thrown in.

The #SAMBAR Rider Checklist SAVES LIVES.Please note that this is a self supported ride, all riders will be subject to scrutiny to make sure they are able to ride this long distance. This is not a race, its a ride. Follow traffic rules. Ride with your group. Maintain sufficient distance between bicycles. Always be alert. Always watch your back. Motorists THINK they have right of way, respect that - they are bigger than us. While most cyclists generally stop to provide assistance, you must be prepared to fend for yourself. Your safety is in your hands. Reach out to fellow riders who are in need of assistance. General Instructions, do Warm up before your ride, hydrate with ORS at least 1 hour before the ride and at regular intervals, consume a light breakfast of at least 100 grms of carbs two hours before the ride.Since we live in a city where weather is unpredictable, please check the comments AND the temporary whatsapp groups about any cancellation of our rides.
