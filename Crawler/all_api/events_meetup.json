Though we'd done seven sins in various forms before, I liked the twist in this one where we had to write about characters degenerating from a virtue to a vice. A bit like the 'fall of man' but in different hues. Would have loved to stay back and listen to the pieces but had to run home. This week I hope to stay back for coffee as well.\n\nWhat will happen this week: Kapil is hosting his second session.
